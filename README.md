# email-surveys
A MERN stack app that creates and sends email surveys which has been deployed on Heroku. Currently a work-in-progress.

This app combines the MERN stack technologies to create a fullstack app that allows clients to sign into the app and pay for credits which are used to create and send email surveys to their customers. I am utilizing Google OAuth for client sign-in, Stripe for payment, and SendGrid for email delivery.
